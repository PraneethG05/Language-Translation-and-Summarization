# Language-Translation-and-Summarization

This project focuses on using advanced NLP techniques to make Hindi-to-English translation more fluent and accurate. Since Hindi and English have very different grammar and sentence structures, translating between them can be tricky, especially with issues like word order, grammar, and cultural context.  

To tackle this, we used the mBART pre-trained model for translating Hindi into English, ensuring the translations are accurate and capture the right meaning. Once translated, we used the Pegasus model to summarize the text, making it concise while keeping the key points intact.  

We also relied on a bilingual corpus and specialized dictionaries to handle vocabulary challenges and improve translation quality across areas like news, literature, and everyday conversations.  

By combining mBART and Pegasus, this project demonstrates how deep learning can address common translation problems, making the results more natural and human-like. The ultimate goal is to create tools that make translations not just accurate but also easy to understand and culturally relevant for Hindi-speaking users.
